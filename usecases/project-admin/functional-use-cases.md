5. `guardProjectRole(resolveProjectRole(...))` verifies project membership or tenant visibility (403 PROJECT_FORBIDDEN)
6. Controller rank rule: rank>=2 — this role: rank 6 >= 2
7. Controller executes; writes activity/audit/notify as listed below
8. Response 200/201 (or domain 4xx: LICENSE_REQUIRED, INVALID_ASSIGNEE, WIP_LIMIT…)
